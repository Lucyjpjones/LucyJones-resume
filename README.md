## &rarr; **User Experience (UX)**

#### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an online presence for myself whilst developing my experience using HTML and CSS frameworks. My main goal is to get myself noticed and increase my chances of getting hired.

The online resume will aim to give users proof of my ability and confidence in what I can do. 

#### User stories

The <u>key priorities</u> for my user are as follows:

1. To be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find the desired content.

2. Ability to access a hard copy of my CV.

3. To view my portfolio of work.

4. Ability to contact me.

5. View my current skills and experience.

6. Access links to my external social accounts.

#### Design

>**It takes about 50 milliseconds for users to form an opinion about your website that determines whether theyâ€™ll stay or leave** - Peep Laja, 2020

- **Structure**
  - A simple design structure with header pattern repeated to make it easy for my users to navigate around the site.

- **Colour scheme**
  - A monochromatic colour scheme to keep the design looking clean and elegant.
  - Key colour is purple which is most frequently associated with creativity and imagination.
  - A white background used throughout the site to avoid any visual obstacles and helping add visual emphasis to other important parts of the design. I decided to use an off-white (#fafafa) as it is easier on the eyes.

- **Typography**
  - The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font if for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

#### Wireframes

As part of the design process, before starting my project I used <u>Balsamiq</u> to create wireframes. Creating these mock-ups helped me plan the basic structure and arrangement of the features for my site.

#### Features used:

- **Responsive on all device sizes**

- **Carousel**
  - A carousel Bootstrap component used to showcase my projects.

  - A contact form with submit button for users to easily get in touch via my website.
  - The form has been set up to ensure all fields are filled out and that the email is written in the correct format.
- **Timelines**
  - Education and work history presented in a timeline to provide a clear summary of my experience.

- **Progress bars**
  - Progress bars used to visually represent my personal skills.
